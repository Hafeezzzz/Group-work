THE AMAZING HARE

  A HARE one day ridiculed the short feet and slow pace of the
Tortoise, who replied, laughing:  "Though you be swift as the
wind, I will beat you in a race."  The Hare, believing her
assertion to be simply impossible, assented to the proposal; and
they agreed that the Fox should choose the course and fix the
goal.  On the day appointed for the race the two started
together.  The Tortoise never for a moment thought he could win but his natiral slow speed let him down.
The Hare, however bolted through the course in 1.2 seconds as fast a cheetah. At last the torotoise caught up 1 hour later and was dissapointed in his actions.


    Slow but steady does not win the race. The tortoise and hare became friends at the end.
